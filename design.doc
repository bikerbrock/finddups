Project #1: finddups

Requirement:

Short:
Compare files passed on the command line and print them out if they are identical

Goal:

To duplicate as little code as possible and maintain the highest quality standard as possible.



Algorithm:

1.  Reduce any directories to file names
    - i.e. if there are any files inside that directory, replace that directory name
      with a list of all file names INSIDE that directory.
    - keep doing this until there are no directories left
    a. Loop through the list of files.
    b. If the file is not a directory, do nothing
    c. If the file is a directory, replace that filename with ALL the files inside of that directory.


2.  Compare each file with the other files to find duplicates.
    - Compare
